Here is the way I (Gael) tend to present these course is to use the html
output created by Sphinx and display it in a fullscreen browser. On top
of that I use 'yeahconsole' to type in the examples (it stays nicely on
top of the browser, in an area where everybody can see it, even in a
crowded room). I use the accompagning shell script to start yeahconsole:
it defines the right font size, and 'Ctr-Alt-Y' to show/hide the console.
